A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a<b<c, for which,
a2+b2=c2
For example, 32+42=9+16=25=52
Given N, Check if there exists any Pythagorean triplet for which a+b+c=N 
Find maximum possible value of abc among all such Pythagorean triplets, If there is no such Pythagorean triplet print −1.

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer T i.e. number of test cases. 
The next T lines will contain an integer N.

Output Format 
Print the value corresponding to each test case in seperate line.

Constraints
